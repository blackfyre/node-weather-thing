## NodeJS based Weather Station as a Mozilla WebThing

The aim is to prowide a Mozilla IoT compliant Weather sensor bundle for your GateWay.

The GateWay should already have NodeJS installed so this doesn't add too much software overhead to your existing setup.

Use the `.env.example` file to create your own `.env` file to get things working (after installing the dependencies, of course).

Just run `node index.js` from the root folder, or you can use a node process manager like PM2 to get things started.
